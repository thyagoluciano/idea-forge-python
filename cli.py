Itâ€™s a **push notification tool** that helps you cut through the noise of the social media algorithm, so when you announce new products or videos/content, instead of hoping people will see it via IG (2% avg engagement rate)or an email newsletter (15-20% avg open rate), it would be sent to peopleâ€™s phones as a push notification (**90% avg engagement rate**), so they definitely see it (100% delivery). **^(TD&LR)** Hereâ€™s what makes push notifications a game-changer: ðŸ”¹ **Immediate attention**: 40% of push notifications are viewed within an hour (vs 7.5 hours for email). ðŸ”¹ **No gatekeepers**: You decide when and how to engage your audience. ðŸ”¹ **Your brand, your rules**: Deliver exclusive updates, perks, or offers right to their device. As my first post here on r/Entrepreneur, I\"d be happy to provide a **free Growth Plan** ($399/mo) to anyone that signs up **by Jan 9th**! ðŸ”¥ Free Sign-Up [**here**](http://unblk.co/tythursday). ðŸ’ª Also receive free support by joining our Slack Channel [**here**](https://join.slack.com/t/unblockedbrands/shared_invite/zt-2vj8itpmu-gjV7X1lzIpWcB3qd1cPG~w).",
