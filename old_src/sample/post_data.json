Also understand that this list suffers from confirmation bias because it's asking the wrong question. It doesn't ask "what qualities offer the highest chance for success". It asks "what qualities do the richest people possess" Imagine putting 10,000 reckless, thoughtless, risktakers in a casino. Now also put 10,000 levelheaded, responsible people in a different casino. Then ask the question "who made the most money?" The top earners will be somebody from the reckless camp just by virtue of the math - ONE of those 10,000 people who kept deciding to risk it all will have actually succeeded. So they double their money and then double it again and double it again. 9,999 of them failed because it's a stupid move. But one of them succeeded and that person will by far have seen more "success" than everybody else put together. Meanwhile, the levelheaded people have no destitute failures. Some did fairly well, others had marginal losses, everybody had a great time. So if we're asking the question "what qualities do the richest people possess" the answer will be that reckless dumbasses make it to the top. If we ask "what qualities offer the highest chance for success" those same qualities are put at the bottom of the list, because for every single success there were 9,999 failures.

I'd start calculating this way in my business model. Let's say you have a retail company. And same case. You can calculate that because people pay immediately and you have 30 days to pay your inventory (and most likely you won't need 3 months of stock from every SKU) you'll need way less money to scale the business and it's easier to grow feasibly. I'd start with this but canvas model helps a lot understanding these parts of your business throughout the year. For example: you have a retail chain and most of the companies you compete with have amazing trade marketing incomes and strategy, but you have nothing in this field. Let's say you'll ask money for each new products for newsletter, social posts etc. In this case it might turn out that because of your business modell you can't to the same as your competitors (for example: working with special products from farmers, asking for larger margins from suppliers than competition since the transparent operation you have (and no after/hidden fees).', 'upvotes': 3}, {'author': 'Dizzy_Orchid_5246', 'created': '2025-01-04 00:12:04', 'text': 'Id agree except for felix dennis‚Äôs how to get rich and bill bartmann‚Äôs books', 'upvotes': 1}, {'author': 'compoundinterest00', 'created': '2025-01-04 02:17:18', 'text': 'Interest reads a book.

For the Fiverr CAD Designer:** Yes, sending an NDA is a smart move. While most Fiverr designers are professional, it‚Äôs best to protect your intellectual property. Make sure the NDA specifies that the design is confidential and cannot be shared or reused. Fiverr also has terms to support your ownership of work done, but an NDA adds an extra layer of protection. **2. For the Manufacturer:** You‚Äôre correct that Chinese contracts must be written in Chinese to be enforceable. If your product is truly unique, consider consulting a professional experienced in Chinese law to draft a bilingual NDA. Otherwise, continue withholding critical details until you‚Äôre further along in the relationship. Often, the biggest risk isn‚Äôt a manufacturer stealing your idea‚Äîit‚Äôs them sharing it with other clients or making knockoffs. A clear contract can help mitigate this. **3. General Advice:** * Only share the minimum details necessary to move forward. * Vet your Fiverr designer by checking reviews and portfolios. * If your idea is highly innovative, consider filing for a provisional patent to give you some early protection while working out details.

If you're shopping on fiverr for CAD support to hire a low-cost freelancer who probably doesn't have any assets, the scenario in which actual enforcement happens is almost non-existent. So rather than optimize for legal enforcement, I think you should optimize for practical risk mitigation. The practical side is vetting who you share information with and limiting what you share to what they actually need to know, regardless of what the NDA language says. It's acting strategically with due diligence instead of relying on the perception that the NDA is doing that for them. If I'm paying someone $300 on fiverr, I need to recognize the risks associated with the transaction. If that person can disrupt my entire business by uploading a few files to the internet, I should acknowledge that risk up front.

First off, I think it's awesome that you're going all in with your SaaS agency. That leap of faith you‚Äôre taking? It‚Äôs a big one, but I can tell you, it‚Äôs one that could change everything for you if you stay focused and keep pushing forward. I‚Äôve been in a similar spot before, wanting to break out of the 9-5 grind and do something meaningful. It‚Äôs tough‚Äîmentally draining, like you said‚Äîbut here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: You have to keep reminding yourself why you‚Äôre doing it. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the day-to-day hustle and lose sight of the bigger picture. It sounds like you have a clear vision, so stick to that when things get tough. I‚Äôm also a firm believer in having a plan, even when you burn the boats. That‚Äôs not to say you need a 10-step plan for everything, but know where you want to go and the actions you need to take to get there. Staying flexible is key because things won‚Äôt always go as planned, but if you‚Äôre adaptable, you'll keep moving forward. And one last thing: Trust the process, but also trust yourself. There will be moments of doubt, of course. That‚Äôs normal. But remember, you‚Äôre betting on yourself, and that‚Äôs powerful. If you stay consistent, learn from each setback, and keep improving, you'll see the progress you want. Good luck with the leap! You‚Äôve got a strong foundation, and I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôll make it work.
